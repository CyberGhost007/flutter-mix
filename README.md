# Flutter MIX

UI experiments with Flutter. What else?

## What's this?

This is a repo full of experiments written in Flutter. Most of the time I just do them as a proof of concept and becuase I enjoy throwing together some UI eye candy. Feel free to copy and use this code at any time but please keep in mind that most of it is written in a very short amount of time and therefore I do not guarentee a good code quality. That's why they're called 'experiments' ðŸ˜‰

## How do I run his?

Just checkout the repo and execute `flutter run` inside the root directory. The app includes a home page from where you can select the different UI experiments. Happy fluttering!
